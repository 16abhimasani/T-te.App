TÃªte is educational platform that focuses on establishing a closer connection between teachers, students, and there peers on a extreme local level. The vision of the app is to be a classroom collaborator, which allows students to give live feedback along with their peers on a teacher's lectures as well as study with the class in the form of group note taking and learning. As a result, it encourages the weaker students to participate more and as a result better and easier than ever.

## Getting Started

Currently I'm working on only the front end of this app. I link 2 different Bootstrap templates in order to play around with the landing page and the dashboard. All the dashboard files are held in the "app" folder.

## Bugs and Issues

The one bug I have right now is that the scroll arrow on the landing page does not smoothly scroll down like the other features. Update*: Arrow fixed now. Smooth scrolling accomplished. 

## Creator

This project was started by Ash Bhimasani, Nihaar Narayan, and Pranav Ranganathan during the 2015 Fall PennApps Hackathon.
